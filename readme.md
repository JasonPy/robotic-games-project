# Robotic Games Project 2021
This repository includes a ROS package that handles the logic of a **mouse** playing the game catch. For this game please refer to [this repository](https://github.com/holger-ziti/RG2021_projects).

## Installation
Clone this package into your `catkin_ws` folder. Then execute `catkin_make`. Make sure that all executable scripts are included in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. 
If now launch files are available yet simply run `rosrun mouse mouse_nav`.
